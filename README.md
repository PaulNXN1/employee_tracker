## Description ðŸ’»

UPenn Module #12 is an assignment to work on MySQL.  The student was tasked to create interfaces that allow the user to interact with databases, called **content management systems (CMS).**

The goal is to create, or program a command-line application with no starter code.  Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL were used to finalize this application.  

A homepage, index.ejs was used as practice with routing for the user to see a homepage.  This was not a requirement of the assignment.

## User Story
